# Why?

As far as I know, activity list is not yet implemented in the Spotify Web app. I like to keep track of what songs my friends are listening to, so I decided to implement this on my own.

# :computer: Installation
1. Copy the repo
2. Open chrome://extensions/ in your chromium based web browser
3. Select *Developer Mode* checkbox
4. Select *Load Unpacked*
5. Select **out** as the target directory
